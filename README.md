# This is a new testing REPO from my local machine to Github 
Using Visual Studio Code tools&commands;
Checking correct creation, modification and delete of files at Github site.
Files and their contents are irrelevant but mostly they will be Python examples, from other open sites.

Additionally, at the end, I will learn and test Github mobile app.
